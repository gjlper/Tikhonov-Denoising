# Tikhonov Denoising
Tikhonov Model for Signal Denoising

Project_1_Report contains a description of the project and codes.

Each .m file is a different approach to denoising a signal or image:

GD_1d.m - Gradient Descent for 1D signal
GD_2d.m - Gradient Descent for 2D signal
GSGC_1d.m - Gauss Seidel and Conjugate Gradient for 1D signal
GSGC_2d.m - Gauss Seidel and Conjugate Gradient for 2D signal
